##### What was annoying or difficult?  
- Longer process for an easy tasks (many unit test for simple functions)
##### What surprised you?  
- the road of writing good tests is very long
##### Did TDD help you write some tests you wouldnâ€™t otherwise have thought of?  
- the task of writing the roman numeral calculator was a bit easier when it was made in smaller steps.
